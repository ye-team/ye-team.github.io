						<h3>Our mission and our values</h3>
                     </div>   
                         <div class="heading-block left">
                       
                        Our lab ethos and academic culture are defined by our members, past and present. This mission statement is drawn and regularly reviewed by members of the Ye lab, who are together building our work environment and our scientific legacy.
                       
                        <br><p></p>
                        <b>Our lab has two main missions:</b>
                        <br><p></p>
                            •	Use cutting-edge techniques to address research questions relevant to understanding dementia and protein misfolding diseases for the advancement of medicine and society. <br><i>We believe that science is borderless and the fruits of research innovation serves the entire humankind.</i>
                        <br><br>
                             •	Provide a nurturing and academically stimulating environment to support researchers with professional maturation and personal growth, guiding members in their career progress and empowering them to reach their full potential. <br><i>We believe in a fair academia where people are accepted of any gender, origin, faith and identity.</i>
                        <br><p></p>
                        
                             We support <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/hr/public/values/1-Values_Behaviours-Framework.pdf">Imperial Values</a>, to which we expect everyone joining our lab to adhere.
                             
                             <br>
                        <b>Members of the lab are guided by shared values:</b>
                        <br><p></p>
                        <b>Empathy</b> As a lab, we seek opportunities to support individuals from underrepresented groups and provide equal opportunities to everyone regardless of background and identity. We appreciate that every individual is different, that everyone has a unique mind and life experience, and not every personal characteristic may be visible. We respect that everyone is entitled to an opinion and that every individual has their own habits and preferences. We work with the Institute and the Department to make our work environment adaptable to accommodate the needs of every individual as much as possible.  
                        <br><p></p>
                        <b>Research</b> As researchers, we believe that success in research requires enthusiasm and dedication, to not abandon in times of difficulty and to not give up in the face of challenges. To achieve tangible outcomes, we are results-oriented and set our priorities and plan our research direction early. We are responsible to our funders, patients and importantly, ourselves. We believe that effective and productive work is balanced with a healthy lifestyle outside work. We are committed to science and we show our dedication by firstly committing to members’ own welfare and personal growth.
                        <br><p></p>
                        <b>Integrity</b> As members of the scientific society, our duty is to report results with the highest level of rigour and honesty. It is our responsibility conduct unbiased experiments and make objective interpretations. Members of the lab should act as the toughest critics of our own research, actively providing constructive criticism and seeking feedback is encouraged. We are confident to take the long road to examine important biological systems that are less well-studied, rather than pursuing follow-up reporting on well-known mechanisms. 
                        <br><p></p>
                        <b>Personal growth</b> As humans, we constantly seek to grow and get better at our tasks. We do make mistakes, but never afraid to make mistakes. Our lab seeks to create a supportive environment to help each other learn from mistakes. The important thing is to learn from our own mistakes, use these to shape our experiences to be confident of overcoming our weaknesses in the future. After all, making mistakes is an integral part of personal growth. Just think, how many times have not the initially failed experiments guided our eventual success for every published research paper! 
                        <br><p></p>     
                        <b>Team spirit</b> As a multi-disciplinary team, we work together and believe that the progress of one individual promotes the advancement of others. It is the expectation that every lab member contributes to upholding our lab ethos and research culture, to support others and encourage others in the lab. We appreciate the strengths in others and accept that individuals have different limitations, and therefore assume the best of intentions in others, as good listeners and considerate communicators. We firmly believe that good lab ethos is built on trust, honesty and positivity, as well as shouldering each other during times of difficulties. 
                        <br><p></p>
                        <b>Teaching</b> As academics, we want to remain humble students who draw wisdom from everyone around us irrespective of status. We seek to recognise talent of the individuals within a group of people. In the lab, we may be teaching junior researchers and students skills and expertise at the professional level, but at the same time we are also enriching our own mind with the knowledge and experience of others. Members of the lab are expected to regularly examine their dedication to scientific research, staying trustworthy to colleagues and practicing what our mission statement preaches. We believe that teaching ultimately serves to illustrate human virtues, to renovate people, and to reach the highest excellence.
